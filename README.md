  <h1>HI! My Name is Mihai!</h1>
</p>


I am a Front End developer knowing and using **Bootstrap** to create websites and apps. I am mainly focused on **Design System** and **Web Accessibility**. I work as a freelancer using **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**. I am constantly evolving and I want to have more challenges. The project that helps me to remain involved is **SISC ( Sindicatul Studenților din Cibernetică)** where I work to improve the students' life. Working with **MySQL and databases** I can make various apps that help them to access the timetable and the events of the project. I am looking for a Junior Front End position or Internship in the same position that helps me to evolve.
